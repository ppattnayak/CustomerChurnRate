# CustomerChurnRate
Predicting a bank's customer churn rate - Data Science A-Z (Udemy).

In this prject, we will use logistic regression to predict if a customer is going to leave the bank or not based on set of independent variables.
Logistic regression is a powerful classification technique and is still the most used one in industry.
Often times, it is a good idea to start with logistic regression and consider this as base.

We will first clean the data. Then build the models and find out the best model among them.
In order to asses model performance, we will use CAP curve and AIC. Model accuracy can be measured using a confusion matrix.
However, accuracy is a bit misleading and might result in overfitting. Therefore, AIC and CAP curve will form the basis of our model selection process.
